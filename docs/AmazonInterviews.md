- Q1. Elevator Problem : 

  There is an Amazon office building (say, YVR26 in Vancouver) with F floors and E elevators.
  Capacity of i_th elevator is P_i persons. Elevators themselves don't have controls,
  instead there are UI panels on each floor, and a rider selects a desired floor and UI
  responds with an elevator ID that will take that rider to a selected floor. An elevator
  may carry riders destined to different floors on a single ride. There may be multiple UI panels
  per floor, allowing multiple riders to make a selection at the same time.

  For simplicity let's assume that riders are "orderly" - always pressing the choice button once
and get into the elevator.

   1. Please lay out the class(es) design for the elevator control system
   Elevator operators would probably like to collect and analyze some metrics on how the system
   behaves at different times of day and what the UX is like.
   2. What data the elevator operators may be interested in?
   3. How the data structure(s) to satisfy operator's needs may look like?
   4. How typical queries may look like?
