# Difference between Recursion and Backtracking:
	* In recursion, the function calls itself until it reaches a base case. 
	* In backtracking, we use recursion to explore all the possibilities until we get the best result for the problem.
	
# Difference between Shallow copy and Deep Copy
	* Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects. 
	* Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well

# Java Serialization and deserialization
	-- Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
	-- Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

	+ implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
		The ObjectOutputStream class contains **writeObject()** method for serializing an Object.
		The ObjectInputStream class contains ** readObject()** method for deserializing an object.
