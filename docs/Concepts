# Difference between Recursion and Backtracking:
	* In recursion, the function calls itself until it reaches a base case. 
	* In backtracking, we use recursion to explore all the possibilities until we get the best result for the problem.
	
# Difference between Shallow copy and Deep Copy
	* Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects. 
	* Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well
